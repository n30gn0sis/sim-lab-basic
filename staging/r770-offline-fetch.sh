# r770-offline-fetch.sh — build the air-gap supply bundle for the R770 lab server.
#
# [sim-lab-basic local divergence, NOT from simlab-build — reapplied at every
#   resync, see docs/kit-sync.md]: monitoring cut (first applied 2026-09-21).
#   The R770 kit no longer deploys Prometheus/Alertmanager/blackbox-exporter/
#   Grafana/cAdvisor, so MONITOR_IMAGES keeps only mkdocs-material (the offline
#   analyst wiki still needs it); the unused stock nginx and docker-registry v2
#   images went with them. The array name and the two output filenames
#   (docker/monitoring-image-list.txt, docker/monitoring-images.tar.gz) are
#   deliberately NOT renamed — see the comment above MONITOR_IMAGES. seed()
#   also never reuses a prior bundle's monitoring tarball (it may predate the
#   trim). Everything else in this file is simlab-build's, byte for byte.
#
# v3.6 (2026-09-14): sections, and any container runtime.
#   Every stage is now a function run by a driver, so the fetch can be run a
#   section at a time:  --only apt,iso   --skip docs   --list   --dry-run
#   (see usage below). --only never implies the manifest stage; finish with
#   --only manifest or let r770-build-bundle.sh do it. A sectioned run appends
#   to BUNDLE_NOTES.md instead of starting it over.
#   The runtime is STAGING_CTR if set, else docker, podman, nerdctl -- judged
#   by capability: `save --help` decides whether --multi-image-archive is
#   needed, and the staging preflight probes that `save` writes docker-archive.
#   Standing lesson from v3.5 (cadvisor moved registries): a GitHub release
#   existing does NOT mean an image was published at that tag -- pin review
#   must verify the image REFERENCE (docker manifest inspect), not the version.
#
# Earlier versions (v3 - v3.5): see `git log --follow -p -- scripts/r770-offline-fetch.sh`.
# Some older entries describe behaviour a later version replaced (e.g. v3's
# original staging-host line named the OS since replaced by v3.4's move to
# Ubuntu 24.04 + Docker CE) — git log gives the accurate, ordered history
# instead of a comment block that can drift out of sync.
#
# RUN THIS ON AN INTERNET-CONNECTED STAGING HOST — NEVER on the air-gapped server.
# Staging host: Ubuntu 24.04 + Docker CE (rootful podman also works).
# Requirements:
#   - Docker Engine (chosen), or rootful podman 4.9+ (then run with sudo)
#   - ~150 GB free across container storage (/var/lib/docker) and the bundle
#     output directory. Check: df -h /var "$(pwd)"
#   - curl, gpg, sha256sum, unzip, wget (docs mirrors; skipped with a WARN if absent)
#
# Output: ./bundle-YYYYMMDD/  with MANIFEST.sha256 and BUNDLE_NOTES.md
# Usage:  r770-offline-fetch.sh [--only s,s] [--skip s,s] [--list] [--dry-run]
